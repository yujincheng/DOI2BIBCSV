  abstract={ Distributed cooperative control of multi-agent systems has been one of the most active research topics in the fields of automatic control and robotics. This paper provides a survey on recent advances in distributed cooperative control under a sampled-data setting, with special emphasis on the published results since 2011. First, some typical sampling mechanisms related to this topic, such as uniform sampling, nonuniform sampling, random sampling, and event-triggered sampling, are summarized in both asynchronous and synchronous paradigms. Then, based on different coordinated tasks, recent results on distributed sampled-data cooperative control of multi-agent systems are categorized into four classes, i.e., sampled-data leaderless consensus, sampled-data leader-following consensus, sampled-data containment control, and sampled-data formation control. For each class, some explicit research lines are identified according to various sampling mechanisms. In particular, depending on definitions of event triggering conditions, some representative event-triggered sampling mechanisms are sorted out and discussed in detail. Finally, several challenging issues for future research are proposed.},

  abstract={We propose an intelligent visuomotor system that interacts with the environment and memorizes the consequences of actions. As more memories are recorded and more interactions are observed, the agent becomes more capable of predicting the consequences of actions and is, thus, better at planning sequences of actions to solve tasks. In previous work, we introduced the aspect transition graph {(ATG)} which represents how actions lead from one observation to another using a directed multi-graph. In this work, we propose a novel aspect representation based on hierarchical {CNN} features, learned with convolutional neural networks, that supports manipulation and captures the essential affordances of an object based on {RGB-D} images. In a traditional planning system, robots are given a pre-defined set of actions that take the robot from one symbolic state to another. However symbolic states often lack the flexibility to generalize across similar situations. Our proposed representation is grounded in the robot's observations and lies in a continuous space that allows the robot to handle similar unseen situations. The hierarchical {CNN} features within a representation also allow the robot to act precisely with respect to the spatial location of individual features. We evaluate the robustness of this representation using the Washington {RGB-D} Objects Dataset and show that it achieves state of the art results for instance pose estimation. We then test this representation in conjunction with an {ATG} on a drill grasping task on Robonaut-2. We show that given grasp, drag, and turn demonstrations on the drill, the robot is capable of planning sequences of learned actions to compensate for reachability constraints.},

  abstract={One reason why Distributed {AI} {(DAI)} technology has been deployed in relatively few real-size applications is that it lacks a clear and implementable model of cooperative problem solving which specifies how agents should operate and interact in complex, dynamic and unpredictable environments. As a consequence of the experience gained whilst building a number of {DAI} systems for industrial applications, a new principled model of cooperation has been developed. This model, called Joint Responsibility, has the notion of joint intentions at its core. It specifies pre-conditions which must be attained before collaboration can commence and prescribes how individuals should behave both when joint activity is progressing satisfactorily and also when it runs into difficulty. The theoretical model has been used to guide the implementation of a general-purpose cooperation framework and the qualitative and quantitative benefits of this implementation have been assessed through a series of comparative experiments in the real-world domain of electricity transportation management. Finally, the success of the approach of building a system with an explicit and grounded representation of cooperative problem solving is used to outline a proposal for the next generation of multi-agent systems.},

  abstract={In this paper, we demonstrate how topological constraints, as well as other abstract constraints, can be integrated into task allocation by applying the combinatorial theory of matroids. By modeling problems as an intersection of matroid constraints, arbitrary combinatorial relationships can be achieved in the task allocation space. To illustrate the expressiveness of the framework, we model a novel task allocation problem that couples abstract per-robot constraints with a communication spanning tree constraint. As our problem is cast as a matroid intersection, provable optimality bounds with simple greedy algorithms follows immediately from theory. Next, we present a decentralized algorithm that applies auction methods to task allocation with matroid intersections. Simulations of task allocation for surveillance in urban environments demonstrate our results. Finally, Monte Carlo results are provided that indicate greedy task allocations can be highly competitive even with near-optimal solutions in practice.},

  abstract={For robots to be a part of our daily life, they need to be able to navigate among crowds not only safely but also in a socially compliant fashion. This is a challenging problem because humans tend to navigate by implicitly cooperating with one another to avoid collisions, while heading toward their respective destinations. Previous approaches have used handcrafted functions based on proximity to model human-human and human-robot interactions. However, these approaches can only model simple interactions and fail to generalize for complex crowded settings. In this paper, we develop an approach that models the joint distribution over future trajectories of all interacting agents in the crowd, through a local interaction model that we train using real human trajectory data. The interaction model infers the velocity of each agent based on the spatial orientation of other agents in his vicinity. During prediction, our approach infers the goal of the agent from its past trajectory and uses the learned model to predict its future trajectory. We demonstrate the performance of our method against a state-of-the-art approach on a public dataset and show that our model outperforms when predicting future trajectories for longer horizons.},

  abstract={We focus on a mobile robot that must learn another robot's motion model from observations to track it in a given map. This problem has several real-world applications such as self-driving cars being electronically towed by other cars and for telepresence robots. Our context is a nested particle filter, a generalization of the traditional particle filter, that allows both self-localization and tracking of another robot simultaneously. While the robot's observations are used to weight nested particles, the problem arises during the propagation step of the nested particles during which a motion model is needed. We introduce a novel layered hidden Markov model for this problem and present an on-line algorithm which learns the {HMM} parameters from observations gathered during the run. We demonstrate significantly improved tracking accuracy on using this new model to predict the motion of a leading mobile robot, in comparison to pre-defined and random motion models as previously used in literature.},

  abstract={Persistent coverage aims to maintain a certain coverage level over time in an environment where such level deteriorates. This level can be associated to temperature, dust or sensor information. We propose an algorithmic solution in which each robot locally finds the best paths and coverage actions to keep the desired coverage level over the whole environment. Using Fast Marching Methods, optimal paths are computed in terms of coverage quality, while keeping a safety distance to obstacles. Additionally, our solution enables a computationally efficient evaluation of a list of potential trajectories, allowing us to choose the one that mostly improves the coverage along the whole path. The combination of this algorithm with a Dynamic Window navigation makes our approach competitive in terms of flexibility and robustness in changing environments with existing solutions. Finally, we also propose a coverage action controller, locally computed and optimal, that makes the robots maintain the coverage level of the environment significantly close to the objective. Simulations and real experiments validate the whole approach.},

First, a novel distributed observer is proposed for each follower to estimate the leader state in a fixed time, then a local tracking controller based on sliding mode technique is proposed such that the estimated leader state is tracked in a fixed time. Both cases of a stationary leader and a dynamic leader are investigated. Since nonholonomic dynamics can better describe the mobile robots in reality, we further extend the results to achieve fixed-time cooperative tracking for multi-robot systems with nonholonomic dynamics. Different from the conventional finite-time cooperative tracking strategies, the fixed-time approach in this work guarantees that an upper bound of settling time can be prescribed without dependence on initial states of robots, which provides additional system information in advance.

Additionally, we introduce a training regimen utilizing an ensemble of policies for each agent that leads to more robust multi-agent policies.

We formally describe the communication graph as a simplicial complex that enables robots to iteratively identify the frontier nodes and coordinate forward motion through the sensing graph. This approach is proved to automatically deform robot teams for collision avoidance and always preserve connectivity. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using numerical simulations.

However, satisfying multiple constraints typically implies formulating multiple barrier functions, which would be ameliorated if the barrier functions could be composed together as Boolean logic formulas. The use of max and min operators, which yields nonsmooth functions, represents one path to accomplish Boolean compositions of barrier functions, and this letter extends previously established concepts for barrier functions to a class of nonsmooth barrier functions that operate on systems described by differential inclusions.

Planning is performed by a distributed receding horizon algorithm where constrained optimization problems are numerically solved for each prediction time-horizon. This approach allows distributed motion planning for a multi-robot system with asynchronous communication while avoiding collisions and minimizing the travel time of each robot. However, the robots dynamics prevents the planned motion to be applied directly to the robots. Using unicycle-like vehicles in a dynamic simulation, we show that deviations from the planned motion caused by the robots dynamics can be overcome by modifying the optimization problem underlying the planning algorithm and by adding an {MPC} for trajectory tracking. Results also indicate that this approach can be used in systems subjected to real-time constraint.},

  abstract={Finding feasible, collision-free paths for multiagent systems can be challenging, particularly in non-communicating scenarios where each agent's intent (e.g. goal) is unobservable to the others. In particular, finding time efficient paths often requires anticipating interaction with neighboring agents, the process of which can be computationally prohibitive. This work presents a decentralized multiagent collision avoidance algorithm based on a novel application of deep reinforcement learning, which effectively offloads the online computation (for predicting interaction patterns) to an offline learning procedure. Specifically, the proposed approach develops a value network that encodes the estimated time to the goal given an agent's joint configuration (positions and velocities) with its neighbors. Use of the value network not only admits efficient (i.e., real-time implementable) queries for finding a collision-free velocity vector, but also considers the uncertainty in the other agents' motion. Simulation results show more than 26\% improvement in paths quality (i.e., time to reach the goal) when compared with optimal reciprocal collision avoidance {(ORCA),} a state-of-the-art collision avoidance strategy.},

As the quantity of robots builds, one of the concerns is the manner by which to dole out priority to the robots with the goal that they can perform the assignment in a collision free condition. In this paper, we are discussing some of the methods that how to find multi robot prioritized path planning techniques.},

  abstract={This paper discusses some of the current state-of-the-art and remaining challenges in research on path planning and vehicle control of autonomous vehicles. Reliable path planning is fundamental for the proper operation of an autonomous vehicle. Typically, the path planner relies on an incomplete model of the surroundings to generate a reference trajectory, used as input to a vehicle controller that tracks this reference trajectory. Depending on how much complexity is put into the path-planning block, the path planning and vehicle-control blocks can be viewed as independent of each other, connected to each other, or merged into one block. There are several types of path-planning techniques developed over the last decades, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks. We review different techniques for path planning and trajectory tracking, and give examples of its use in relation to autonomous vehicles. We report on our own recent findings and give an outlook on potential research directions.},

  abstract={This paper studies the problem of vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping {(SLAM)} in dynamic environments with multiple cameras. These cameras move independently and can be mounted on different platforms. All cameras work together to build a global map, including {3D} positions of static background points and trajectories of moving foreground points. We introduce intercamera pose estimation and intercamera mapping to deal with dynamic objects in the localization and mapping process. To further enhance the system robustness, we maintain the position uncertainty of each map point. To facilitate intercamera operations, we cluster cameras into groups according to their view overlap, and manage the split and merge of camera groups in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can work robustly in highly dynamic environments and produce more accurate results in static environments.},

  abstract={State-of-the-art systems that place recognition in a group of \$n\$ robots either rely on a centralized solution, where each robot's map is sent to a central server, or a decentralized solution, where the map is either sent to all other robots, or robots within a communication range. Both approaches have their drawbacks: centralized systems rely on a central entity, which handles all the computational load and cannot be deployed in large, remote areas, whereas decentralized systems either exchange \$n\$ times more data or preclude matches between robots that visit the same place at different times while never being close enough to communicate directly. We propose a novel decentralized approach, which requires a similar amount of data exchange as a centralized system, without precluding any matches. The core idea is that the candidate selection in visual bag-of-words can be distributed by preassigning words of the vocabulary to different robots. The result of this candidate selection is then used to choose a single robot to which the full query is sent. We validate our approach on real data and discuss its merit in different network models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use a distributed inverted index in multirobot place recognition.},
